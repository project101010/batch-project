🔁 Auto Logout

💬 Feedback System

💡 What Makes This Project Stand Out?
🚦 Low Bandwidth Friendly
No heavy images or media files — lightning-fast loading even on slow internet connections.

👥 Multi-Admin Support
Unlike typical systems with a single admin, this platform allows multiple authorized admins to manage examinations.

All user actions are governed by a central control system for enhanced security and flexibility.

🏫 Designed for Educational Institutions
Ideal for:

Admins (headdash.php) – Directors or department heads

Teachers (dash.php) – Professors and lecturers

Students (account.php) – Learners attempting the exams

Home Page (index.php) – Common landing page for all users

🔒 Password Privacy First
User credentials are fully encrypted.

Even administrators cannot access user passwords — ensuring complete user trust and system integrity.

📢 Built-in Feedback System
Encourages users to share ideas, report bugs, or request new features.
